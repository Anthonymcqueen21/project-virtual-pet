AUTOMATED ACCEPTANCE TESTS USING SELENIUM
Note that this covers all manual acceptance tests except Canvas integration (which requires a real user's token), clicking on the pet (which requires observation of an animation), and notifications (which require user's permission and cannot be fully automated)
Tests were run on the desktop version of Study Buddy on Mac in Chrome drivers using Selenium

User drags ‘accessories’ to the avatar and the animations are now changed to show the avatar wearing the ‘accessory’.
2. User drags ‘candies’ to the avatar.
3. The avatar shows an eating animation and a satisfied animation.
4. A stat (or set of stats, possibly chosen by the User) increases when the ‘candy’ is consumed.
